# Crystal Dataset Crawler

This project is a Python script for crawling and processing images from the web. It uses various libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `PIL`, `scipy`, `argparse`, `huggingface_hub`, `natsort`, `pathlib`, `functools`, and `dghs-imgutils`.

## Features

- Crawls images from the web based on provided URLs.
- Processes and classifies images based on various scores such as `anime_real_score`, `aesthetic_score`, and `monochrome_score`.
- Deduplicates images based on a similarity threshold.
- Moves images to different folders based on their classification.

## Requirements

The required Python libraries are listed in the [requirements.txt](/C:/Users/Crystal427/Downloads/CrystalDatasetCrawler/requirements.txt) file. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Used library
Crawler use [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) to crawl picture,etc.
Rating image use [imgutils](https://github.com/deepghs/imgutils) to Rate and categories pictures.

# How to use?
write a the links to **./web.txt**ï¼Œthen run the scripts. 

```bash
python main.py --real_threshold VALUE --aesthetic_threshold VALUE --monochrome_threshold VALUE --similarity_threshold VALUE
```   

**Parser info** 

--real_threshold  The threshold for detecting whether an image is a real picture, defaults to 0.9.   
--aesthetic_threshold  The aesthetic score of the image, defaults to 0.35.  
--monochrome_threshold The threshold for detecting whether an image is monochrome, defaults to 0.9  
--similarity_threshold The threshold for performing Phash deduplication on images defaults to 0.2

##SPILTED@taskname2  
website4  
website5  
website6  
##SPILTED@taskname3
