- Deduplicates images based on a similarity threshold.
- Moves images to different folders based on their classification.

## Requirements

The required Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

write a the links to **./web.txt**ï¼Œthen run the scripts. 

```bash
python main.py --real_threshold VALUE --aesthetic_threshold VALUE --monochrome_threshold VALUE --similarity_threshold VALUE
```   

**Parser info** 

--real_threshold  The threshold for detecting whether an image is a real picture, defaults to 0.9.   
--aesthetic_threshold  The aesthetic score of the image, defaults to 0.35.  
--monochrome_threshold The threshold for detecting whether an image is monochrome, defaults to 0.9  
--similarity_threshold The threshold for performing Phash deduplication on images defaults to 0.2
